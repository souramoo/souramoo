# Hi there, I'm [Souradip](https://souradip.com) 👋

I'm a **British Physician-Scientist** in-training (currently studying for my PhD and a medical degree from the University of Cambridge). 🩺🧪

I've also been writing code since 2006. 💻

I'm especially interested in **applying deep learning to medicine** and I've contributed back to projects e.g. [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/pull/1550).

I'm also **Co-President of St Catharine's College MCR** (the society for graduate students) and publish parts of our online infrastructure as open source e.g. the [formal hall booking system](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-formal-hall) and projects to **improve transparency for social good**, e.g. the [accommodation database](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-rooms-database) to easily compare college rents with the private market, and used to negotiate rent arrangements on behalf of all of the graduate students.

I have extensive experience in **building technology to support social activism**, and am a Co-Director of a charity for [widening access to medicine](https://wearemedics.com).

You'll also find fun projects, e.g. a [message board people can text](https://github.com/souramoo/TextWall) at parties, a [spatial video chat system](https://github.com/souramoo/party) to host more natural parties during a global pandemic, some of my work in [Android reverse-engineering](https://github.com/souramoo/Needle), web apps (e.g. a [comments plugin](https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus) for static websites), [home automation](https://github.com/souramoo/ReverseEngineeredMiLightBluetooth) and more.
