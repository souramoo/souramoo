# Hi there, I'm [Souradip](https://souradip.com) ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ©º I'm a **British Physician-Scientist** in-training (currently studying for my PhD and a medical degree from the University of Cambridge). ðŸ§ª

ðŸ’» I've been writing code since 2006.

- I'm especially interested in **applying deep learning to medicine** and I've contributed back to projects e.g. [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/pull/1550).

- I'm **Co-President of St Catharine's College MCR** (the society for graduate students) and I publish parts of our online infrastructure as open source including
   - The [formal hall booking system](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-formal-hall)
   - Projects to **improve transparency for social good**, e.g. the [accommodation database](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-rooms-database) to easily compare college rents with the private market, and used to negotiate rent arrangements on behalf of all of the graduate students.

- Extensive experience in **building technology to support social activism**, and I build the tech stack of a [widening access to medicine](https://wearemedics.com) charity.

- I also post fun projects, e.g.
   - a [message board people can text](https://github.com/souramoo/TextWall) at parties
   - a [spatial video chat system](https://github.com/souramoo/party) to host more natural parties during a global pandemic
   - some of my work in [Android reverse-engineering](https://github.com/souramoo/Needle)
   - web apps (e.g. a [comments plugin](https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus) for static websites)
   - [home automation](https://github.com/souramoo/ReverseEngineeredMiLightBluetooth)
