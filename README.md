# Hi there, I'm [Souradip](https://souradip.com) 👋

   - The [formal hall booking system](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-formal-hall)
   - Projects to **improve transparency for social good**, e.g. the [accommodation database](https://github.com/souramoo/mcr-room-database) to easily compare college rents with the private market, and used to negotiate rent arrangements on behalf of all of the graduate students.

- Extensive experience in **building tech for social activism**, and I build the tech stack of a [widening access to medicine](https://wearemedics.com) charity. 🗣
